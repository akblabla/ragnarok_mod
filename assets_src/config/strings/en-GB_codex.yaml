  codex_commander_flagship_wulfar_lore2_text: "Chief Wulfar is the leader of Aurania’s largest and oldest outlaw clan. Standing more than 7 feet tall and wielding his great stone battle-hammer, he certainly cuts an imposing figure. But enemies should be wary of more than just his immense weapon and towering physique. It is Wulfar’s patience, intelligence and immovable resolve that render him a truly fearsome adversary."
  codex_commander_flagship_wulfar_lore3_text: "For as long as there have been laws, there have been outlaws. Nowhere is this fact better illustrated than in Wulfar’s lineage. It was more than a century ago that Wulfar’s great grandfather, Magnus \"Bluetongue\" Pasternak, an infamous pirate captain, left his life on the high seas to settle in The Lost Leagues. There, he married Wulfar’s great grandmother, the shepherdess and renowned smuggler Mary Meyrick. These are but two individuals in the vast web of buccaneers and bootleggers, crooks and cutpurses that constitute Wulfar’s family tree."
  codex_groove_description_flagship_wulfar: "Wulfar can order his crew to fire a mighty barage from the broadside of his vessel. Enemies at closest row of tiles take 100% of the flagship's normal attack damage, with each subsequent row dealing 1/3 less. The broadside can hit any enemy target, even those hiding in the fog of war. \n\nGroove Charge Speed: Fast."
  codex_title_strategy_flagship_wulfar: "Broadside Strategy"
  codex_groove_strategy_flagship_wulfar: "The broadside only deals full damage in the first row, so even if multiple angles might hit the same targets, consider who takes the full brunt of the broadside."
