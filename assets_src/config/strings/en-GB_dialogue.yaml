  # STORY MAIN 1 Prologue
  # Cutscene: Start of match. Vesper stalks Emeric's ship
  ragnarok_main1_cutscene_intro_1stMate_00: "Finally! We've been trailing this damn ship for weeks, and now they're in sight![short_pause] Time for some action, let's get 'em!"
  ragnarok_main1_cutscene_intro_Vesper_00: "Indeed, it's time for us to make our move."
  ragnarok_main1_cutscene_intro_Vesper_01: "Men! Raise the clan flag!"
  # Vesper catches up to Emeric's ship
  ragnarok_main1_cutscene_intro_Emeric_00: "What is this ruckus!"
  ragnarok_main1_cutscene_intro_Emeric_01: "Oh, pirates.[short_pause] I should've expected we'd be accosted by ruffians at some point."
  ragnarok_main1_cutscene_intro_Emeric_02: "It's always so tiresome having to deal with these people..."
  ragnarok_main1_cutscene_intro_Emeric_03: "What are your demands?" #Maybe have Emeric insult her directly instead of Vesper overhearing the internal conversation among Emeric's crew.
  ragnarok_main1_cutscene_intro_Vesper_02: "Tiresome?[short_pause] You insult me[slow]! [slow]I am nothing if not exciting[slow], [slow]and so is this heist!"
  ragnarok_main1_cutscene_intro_Vesper_03: "It's not every day you steal a king's crown!"
  #ragnarok_main1_cutscene_intro_Emeric_04: "[fast]What?![short_pause] The crown?![short_pause] No![short_pause] We have gold and jewels you can take if you'll leave peacefully, but the crown stays[slow]. [slow]There [colour:player_red]will[colour:r] be bloodshed if you come for it[slow]. [slow]Surely, neither of us want that.[fast]"
  ragnarok_main1_cutscene_intro_Emeric_04: "[fast][shaking]The crown!?[shaking][short_pause] Have you been tracking us?[short_pause] Gah, that lookout..."
  ragnarok_main1_cutscene_intro_Emeric_05: "No matter.[short_pause] If you want a fight, you'll get a fight"
  ragnarok_main1_cutscene_intro_Vesper_04: "Adorable" 
  ragnarok_main1_cutscene_intro_Vesper_05: "Sic 'em!"
  # Boarding begins
  
  #Ingame Dialogue:
  #When Emeric feels threatened and starts pushing with his spear line and himself
  ragnarok_main1_challenge_Emeric_00: "I won't let you take this ship so easily!"
  #When Emeric is about to lose
  ragnarok_main1_panic_Emeric_00: "You won't get away this, you scoundrel! You *will* be held accountable, the Cherry Fleet will make sure of it."
  #Vesper: "Hah! The [wavy]Cherry Fleet[wavy]! They'll catch me with what, their blueberry boats and banana barges?"  
  
  
  #Cutscene: Victory. Vesper confronts Emeric
  ragnarok_main1_cutscene_end_Vesper_00: "Well fought, monsieur."
  ragnarok_main1_cutscene_end_Emeric_00: "You will not get past me. The crown stays."
  #Emeric charges up a lightning blast, but gets interrupted and stunned by Vesper. A cherrystone crownbearer gets spooked behind emeric.
  ragnarok_main1_cutscene_end_Vesper_01: "Now, now, let's not make a scene."
  ragnarok_main1_cutscene_end_Vesper_02: "I'll just be taking this."
  ragnarok_main1_cutscene_end_Vesper_03: "Thank you."
  ragnarok_main1_cutscene_end_Vesper_04: "Au revoir!"
  #Emeric wakes up confused
  ragnarok_main1_cutscene_end_Emeric_01: "[wavy]...What was that...[wavy]"
  ragnarok_main1_cutscene_end_Emeric_02: "The crown!?[short_pause] [shaking]No![shaking]"
  ragnarok_main1_cutscene_end_Emeric_03: "Rally the fleet!"
  ragnarok_main1_cutscene_end_Emeric_04: "I will not let her and her cretins just cruise away!"
  
  #Cutscene: Interlude. Vesper and her crew are sailing south with the cherry fleet on their tail
  ragnarok_main1_cutscene_interlude_2ndMate_00: "Ma'am[slow]...[slow][short_pause] Pardon me...[short_pause] Mademoiselle, the Cherryfleet is trailing us."
  #ragnarok_main1_cutscene_interlude_Vesper_00: "Yes. This is why we are going through Felheim."
 # ragnarok_main1_cutscene_interlude_2ndMate_01: "[wavy]*gulp*[wavy][short_pause] Are you suggestion using the old backdoor?"
  #ragnarok_main1_cutscene_interlude_Vesper_01: "Are you suggesting going through the fleet instead, darling?"
  ragnarok_main1_cutscene_interlude_Vesper_00: "Yes. We'll use the old backdoor to throw them off though. The fjords of Felheim should slow them down."
  ragnarok_main1_cutscene_interlude_2ndMate_01: "Oh, we'll be passing by Garbhof then, right? I wish we had time to stop for pint of ale..."
  ragnarok_main1_cutscene_interlude_Vesper_01: "There'll be plenty of time to celebrate at the hideout later, darling."
  ragnarok_main1_cutscene_interlude_Vesper_02: "So, stop your whinging."
  ragnarok_main1_cutscene_interlude_Vesper_03: "We'll party when the deal has gone through!"

  ragnarok_main2_cutscene_start_1stMate_00: "Wait, chief! You forgot the crown!"
  ragnarok_main2_cutscene_start_1stMate_01: "Oh bother.[long_pause] Lets grab a rowboat."

  ragnarok_main2_ingameIntro_Crew_01: "The town's being attacked! The streets are full of skeletons!"
  ragnarok_main2_ingameIntro_Crew_02: "And also a bunch of dead people!"
  ragnarok_main2_ingameIntro_2ndMate_00: "Wait no! The Tarvern!"
  ragnarok_main2_ingameIntro_Vesper_00: "Don't you worry about these silly xylophones. They should be easy enough to outmaneuver."
  ragnarok_main2_ingameIntro_2ndMate_01: "No! Not the tavernkeep!"
  ragnarok_main2_ingameIntro_2ndMate_02: "And the innkeeper! Have they no mercy?!"
  ragnarok_main2_ingameIntro_Vesper_01: "Shush."
  ragnarok_main2_ingameIntro_2ndMate_03: "But, but... my ale...?"
  ragnarok_main2_ingameIntro_Vesper_02: "The undead are none of our concern. We just need to get the crown past them."
  #1st Mate lands via a barge with the crown
  ragnarok_main2_ingameIntro_1stMate_00: "Wait,[short_pause] [wavy]*gasp*[wavy] the crown!"
  ragnarok_main2_ingameIntro_Vesper_03: "Just pass it along. We don't have all day."
  
  #After you move the crownbearer for the first time
  ragnarok_main2_postThrow_Vesper_00: "Do keep yourself safe with the crown. I won't have you fight whilst holding it. It's fragile."
  #ragnarok_main2_ingameIntro_Crew_00: "Aww, ma'am, it's sweet that you worry about us!"
  #ragnarok_main2_postThrow_Vesper_00: "What? No. The crown. You could damage it!"
  
  #If you lose a unit to a rifle man
  ragnarok_main2_keepYaHeadDown_Vesper_00: "Keep your heads down!"
  ragnarok_main2_keepYaHeadDown_Vesper_01: "We do not give the enemy free practice shooting!"

  #When you beat the mission
  ragnarok_main2_ending_Crew_00: "The crown has been secured!"
  ragnarok_main2_ending_Vesper_00: "Exquisite!"
  #Emeric's fleet arives from the east
  ragnarok_main2_ending_Emeric_00: "There they are! We can't let them get away!"
  ragnarok_main2_ending_Vesper_01: "I see you've woken up from your little nap."
  ragnarok_main2_ending_Vesper_02: "But sadly, I don't have time for chit chat."
  ragnarok_main2_ending_Vesper_03: "So if you don't mind, we'll just take our leave!"
  ragnarok_main2_ending_Emeric_01: "You won't shake us of this easily, pirate!"

  # Cutscene: Interlude. Vespers is traveling along the fjord towards the outlaw HQ
  ragnarok_main2_cutscene_interlude_1stMate_00: "Why are we even heading back to the hideout anyway?"
  ragnarok_main2_cutscene_interlude_1stMate_01: "I thought our contact would meet us at Dragon's Dawn?"
  ragnarok_main2_cutscene_interlude_Vesper_00: "Do you not know? The grand election for the title of clan chief is in a few days!"
  ragnarok_main2_cutscene_interlude_Vesper_01: "And you know, as the chieftain it is proper etiquette to formally congratulate the new chieftain."
  ragnarok_main2_cutscene_interlude_1stMate_02: "Uhm[slow]...[slow][short_pause] I thought you only cared about the deal getting through?"
  ragnarok_main2_cutscene_interlude_Vesper_02: "Oh, it is still all about the deal."
  ragnarok_main2_cutscene_interlude_Vesper_03: "We just need a little help from a friend of mine."

  ragnarok_main3_cutscene_start_Rival_01: "Election day is coming up, and you are clearly not fit to lead the clan."
  ragnarok_main3_cutscene_start_Rival_02: "I hereby challenge thee to a[short_pause] Pirate Bout!"
  ragnarok_main3_cutscene_start_Wulfar_00: "If the clan wants the better pirate as their chief..."

  #Ingame Dialogue:
  #Start of match after cutscene
  ragnarok_main3_ingameIntro_Wulfar_00: "We have to steal more gold from villages than our rival."
  ragnarok_main3_ingameIntro_Wulfar_01: "Our barges can steal 300 gold, but can't carry units while doing so."
  ragnarok_main3_ingameIntro_Wulfar_02: "They can deposit at either our flagship or our docks."
  ragnarok_main3_ingameIntro_Wulfar_03: "Sure lad..."
  ragnarok_main3_ingameIntro_Wulfar_04: "Let's head out!"
  
  #Wulfar Wins

  ragnarok_main3_ingameDraw_Rival_00: "I guess so, but who is going to be elected as clan chief then?"
  ragnarok_main3_ingameDraw_Wulfar_01: "This was just a show. It is a democratic election afterall. Let's go home and see the results."
  
  #Donation
  ragnarok_main3_ingameDonation_Wulfar_00: "Could ya hold this coin for me? I have more gold to rob!"
  ragnarok_main3_ingameDonation_Rival_00: "Uhm, thanks?"
